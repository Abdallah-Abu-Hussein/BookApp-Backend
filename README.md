## Overview
For today’s assignment, you will READ book data by connecting your front-end React app to a back-end Express server. Your Express server will connect to a Mongo database. You will need to make a “schema” in your back-end code to model how you want your data to look. You will then populate your database with “seed” data—some of your favorite books. When the front end makes a request to your server, your server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Your front end will display these results.
